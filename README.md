This project is to showcase java skillset 
and to develope my skills in frontend and
creating interactive GUI's. 
This project is a homage to the 
original game "The Oregon Trail" 
and this project currently is
still in development. As of Aug 29,
the game logic is 75% complete.
A 2d array of the map is created 
dynamically and a randomized world 
is created including random terrain, 
random weather, random events, 
and a scoring system that links to a sql database.
Using lists,arrays,hashmaps and stacks, this game showcases
knowledge of java including classes, OOP and 
input/output. While this project is still
being developed,there will be more 
updates on the status.
